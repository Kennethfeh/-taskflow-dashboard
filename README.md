# TaskFlow Dashboard

High-fidelity dashboard concept plus blueprint/handoff docs.

## What’s Inside
- `/` marketing + product overview.
- `/blueprint` route with sitemap, grid specs, motion, and dev checklist.
- `/docs` folder capturing tokens + architecture.

## Why It Helps
- Shows how I translate dense product requirements into a cohesive system.
- Highlights accessibility, motion, and documentation skills that align with the job brief.

## Collaboration Notes
- `/blueprint` spells out the IA, responsive grids, motion guidelines, and developer checklist that accompany the mocks.
- `/docs/design-system.md` and `/docs/architecture.md` explain the tokens, spacing, and user journey decisions.
- Design file: [TaskFlow Dashboard Spec](https://www.figma.com/file/gamemaker-taskflow/TaskFlow-Dashboard-Spec?type=design).

Deploy on Vercel with the standard Next.js command (`next build`) and surface the live URL + design file in your application packet.
