# TaskFlow Dashboard

High-fidelity dashboard concept plus blueprint/handoff docs.

## Overview
- **Brief**: Demonstrate how I design an enterprise workflow dashboard—marketing story plus in-app views—while documenting implementation details.
- **Role**: Solo designer leading research synthesis, IA, system design, and handoff.
- **Outcome**: Interactive marketing page, blueprint route, doc set, and Figma file.

## What’s Inside
- `/` marketing + product overview.
- `/blueprint` route with sitemap, grid specs, motion, and dev checklist.
- `/docs` folder capturing tokens + architecture.

## Process & Decisions
1. **IA & Wireframes** – Blueprint route outlines sitemap + responsive grids before detailing the visuals.
2. **Design System** – Tokens (color, spacing, card primitives) live in `docs/design-system.md` and power both marketing + app UI.
3. **QA + Handoff** – Blueprint + docs highlight motion specs, accessibility requirements, and developer checklists to keep build quality high.

## Collaboration Notes
- `/blueprint` spells out the IA, responsive grids, motion guidelines, and developer checklist that accompany the mocks.
- `/docs/design-system.md` and `/docs/architecture.md` explain the tokens, spacing, and user journey decisions.
- Design file: [TaskFlow Dashboard Spec](https://www.figma.com/file/gamemaker-taskflow/TaskFlow-Dashboard-Spec?type=design).

## How to Present This Project
1. Deploy on Vercel with the standard Next.js command (`next build`).
2. Share the live URL plus `/blueprint`, `/docs`, and the Figma link in your application materials.
3. Talk through the “Process & Decisions” steps during interviews to highlight strategic thinking in addition to visuals.
